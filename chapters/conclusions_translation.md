### Our plea

@css[title-note text-white](When researching people’s history)
@snapend

@ol[list-spaced-bullets list-boxed-bullets text-07]
- think of creating \*data\* (not only as a byproduct)
- it is right there – e.g.:
    - person born in place
    - person educated at institution
    - person translated work
    - work is translation of work
    - …
- you are not alone

#### And now for some discussion…
@snapend


@ol[list-spaced-bullets list-boxed-bullets text-08]
- connecting the dots?
- reuse existing data @css[text-blue fragment](\>\> "you are not alone", again)
- data integration
- multilinguality
- technical formats and standards to use?
